# PIJLab_Assignment1
Part1: Implement a menu-driven Java program (like fib or factorial) to implement these input methods
in java (command line args, Scanner, BufferedReader, DataInputStream, Console )
This repository contains a Java program implementing a simple menu-driven console application. The application offers two functionalities: calculating the factorial of a given number and generating a specified number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence.

Part2: Implement a simple menu driven calculator in java to implement add, sub, mul, div, sqrt, power,
mean, variance. Implement a separate Calculator class to include all related function inside that class.
(mean calculation : program reads numbers from the keyboard, summing them in the process until the
user enters the string "end". It then stops input & displays the avg. of numbers)
This repository contains a Java program for a simple calculator that performs various mathematical operations. The program includes a Calculator class with methods for basic arithmetic operations, square root, power, mean, and variance. Additionally, an Input class provides a console interface for interacting with the calculator.
